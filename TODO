* figure out a good fix for grid prob at screen.cpp:376
* screen.cpp causes a segfault (if you uncomment line 333) while trying to delete
  the back array. The segfault is actually in the bmp_surface (SDL_Surface) which
  makes it segfault while it is freed. This surface is in pixie and pixien.

* make MAX_LEVELS matter when saving and loading games
