Openglad 0.97:
	Not many groundbreaking changes. Openglad-enhanced
	was branched, so this is now a bugfix-only branch,
	so don't expect major changes.
	
	However, the game should be more stable and eat up
	less ram now :-)

Openglad 0.95:
	This is a fully functional release. All the features
	have been implemented so its a full port. Play it
	with your friends, family, pets, etc...
