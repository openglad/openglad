[0] Installation information

  For this release of Gladiator, it is important that you run the
  'setup' program after unzipping the files to your directory.
  This will ensure that the settings are correct for your system.
  If you wish to change the settings later, you can re-run setup,
  or manually edit the 'glad.cfg' text file.

  Gladiator features Sound Blaster compatible sound.
  Note that for sound to work, the "BLASTER" environment variable
  needs to be set in your autoexec.bat.  It should like:
        BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T2
  or something similar.  Gladiator may, unfortunately, freeze up
  if your card is not 100% sound blaster compatible.  If it does
  this you have 2 options.
    1) You can try downloading updated sound card
       drivers from your sound card manufacturer.
    2) You can re-disable the sound, and look for
       an updated Gladiator version in case we
       have been able to resolve this problem.


[1] Keyboard Controls

  [1.a] Description
  Gladiator is designed to allow up to four players to use the
  keyboard at once (although we admit it would be rather
  cramped).  Each player has a number of 'action' keys, such as
  movement or attacking, and also a set of preferences, which
  are reached from the 'options menu,' and control things such
  as game speed or viewport size.  Important to remember are the
  'ESC' key, which will abort your current mission and return
  you to the 'picker' screen, and the 'F1' key, which will bring
  up a brief help display during the game.

  [1.b] Movement keys
  Player 1       Player 2       Player 3       Player 4
  --------       --------       --------       -------- 
  7  8  9        Q  W  E        U  I  O        R  T  Y
   \ | /          \ | /          \ | /          \ | /
  4-   -6        A-   -D        J-   -L        F-   -H
   / | \          / | \          / | \          / | \
  1  2  3        Z  X  C        M  ,  .        V  B  N

  [1.c] Other 'action' keys
  Other keys used 'actively' while playing the game are:
  Action     Player 1       Player 2       Player 3       Player 4
  ------     --------       --------       --------       -------- 

  Fire       INSERT         CONTROL        SPACE          5 (non numeric)

  Special    ENTER          ALT            Semicolon(;)   6 (non numeric)

  Cycle      - (numeric)    1              7              3
  Special

  Switch     + (numeric)    TAB            BACKSPACE      EQUALS (=)
  Character

  Shifter    DELETE         LEFT-SHIFT     RIGHT-SHIFT    - (non numeric)

  Yell       5 (numeric)    S              K              G

  Options    Asterisk       2              8              4
  Menu       (numeric)

  Not all of these keys will work at all times.  For example, if
  your special costs 100 magic points and you only have 50,
  pressing your special key won't have an effect.  Similarly,
  if you are a first-level mage and don't have the 'warp-space'
  spell, you can't cycle through other specials because you don't
  have them.

  The 'shifter' key can be used in combination with others.  In
  particular:
   * Shifter + Yell    : Summon NPC's on your team to come fight with
                         or protect you.
   * Shifter + Switch  : Switch to next TYPE of team member; ie, jump
                         to your first archer.
   * Shifter + Special : Invoke a related version of a special ability.
                         For example, shifter+special when a Mage has
                         the Teleport ability selected will attempt to
                         place a 'marker' for future teleports.
                         Note that not all specials have an alternate!

  [1.d] Options menu
  From the options menu you can control several aspects of the
  game.  Some of these affect only you, while others change the
  game state for all players.  While the options menu is open,
  gameplay pauses for all characters (and enemies!).

   * +/- : Make the game run slower or faster (for all)
   * [/] : Enlarge or shrink your viewscreen (player-specific)
   * </> : Brighten or darken the game screen (for all)

   *   C : Toggle color-cycling on or off (for all)
   *   F : Toggle the foes/allies display on or off (player-specific)
   *   H : Cycle through hitpoint/spellpoint display modes (player-spec.)
   *   K : Change the default keyboard mapping (player-specific)
   *   R : Toggle radar display on or off (player-specific)
   *   S : Toggle the score/exp display on or off (player-specific)
   *   T : Bring up an overview of your team's status


[2] Overview
    Gladiator is a gauntlet style, real-time arcade game where you
  (the red team) must set out to destroy your enemies (and pick up
  treasure!) in a variety of scenarios.  You get to sharpen the 
  skills of your team as you progress through the levels, and each
  character class (Fighter, Mage, etc.) has a number of special
  abilities which come into play as your character gains levels.

[3] How to play -- a brief tutorial

A) The Picker
  When you first start a game of Gladiator, you actually start in
  the 'picker' (short for "Team Picker") instead of the playing
  field itself.  The picker's main menu gives you several choices:
  Begin a new game, continue with your current or saved game, or
  exit.  There is also a set of four buttons to control how many
  human players will be in the game (up to four), and a toggle to
  control the difficulty settings.  For now, select Begin New Game.

  The next screen of the picker allows you to save or load games (useful 
  later on), train your current team, view your team, or, finally, hire
  new members for your squad.  Since you don't have any team members yet,
  the first thing to do is "Hire Troops".

  Choosing the "Hire Troops" menu takes you to a screen which will display
  the name/type of a new recruit, his statistics, and the cost to
  purchase him, along with your current cash, which for a new game
  begins at 5000.  From this point you may buy this character, raise
  his stats (and cost) in various amounts, or, using the "NEXT" and
  "PREV" buttons near the top, see what other characters are availible.

  Generally, new abilities come every three levels (at levels 1, 4,
  7, and 10).  Sometimes you'll also have 'alternate' abilities granted
  at a given level; these often have other restrictions of use.  For
  example, the mage gets an alternate special -- teleport marker -- at
  level 1, but he must have at least 75 Intelligence before it becomes
  usable.

  A brief sample of basic troop types follows; for more detailed   
  information, including special abilities, consult the classes.txt file.
    * Soldier:  Your basic grunt, can absorb and deal damage and moves
                moderately fast.  A good all-around fighter.
    *     Elf:  Elves are small and weaker, but are harder to hit.
                Elves throw stones, sometimes more than one.
    *  Archer:  Archers are fleet of foot, and their arrows have a
                long range.  Although they're not as strong or healthy
                as fighters, they can also be a good squad backbone.
    *    Mage:  Mages are slow, nearly defenseless, and horrible at
                hand-to-hand combat, but their magical energy balls
                pack a big punch.  All mages, regardless of level,
                posess the ability to teleport out of (or into!) danger,
                providing they've saved enough magic.
    *  Cleric:  Clerics, also, are slow, but have a stronger hand-
                to-hand than mages.  Clerics have the unique ability to
                generate fields which their teammates can pass through, but
                which foes must hack down to pass.  Clerics also posess
                the ability to heal teammates who are standing next to
                them.
    *   Thief:  Theives are fast and stronger of constitution than the
                magic-wielders, though not so potent as the soldier.
                A thief, in addition to throwing daggers, can plant
                a bomb which can take out even the strongest opponent.
                Beware, however -- unlike an archer's arrows, bombs
                do not discriminate in who they destroy!  Skilled
                thieves can even hide themselves from their enemies'
                sight.
    *   Druid:  Druids are the magicians of nature, and have special
                powers over natural events.  Druids can throw lightning
                bolts at their foes, and can grow trees to impede the
                progress of their enemies.  At more powerful levels,
                the druids can even summon faeries to their aid.

    In general, each character has at least three 'special abilities,' and
    some have more, although it often requires gaining several levels
    before these other special abilities become availible.

    You will also come up against other foes -- undead such as skeletons
    and ghosts, magical beings such as elementals and faeries, and others.
    These types are availble for purchase only in the registered version
    of Gladiator, although some may join your team on their own at
    certain times.

    The statistics from which you can choose to modify here are:

    *     Strength: Strength affects your melee (hand-to-hand) combat,
                    as well as things like your weapon range.

    * Constitution: Constitution increases your hitpoints and rate of 
                    healing, and also affects other combat-related
                    skills.

    *    Dexterity: Dexterity helps improve your ability to dodge, 
                    your weapon's accuracy, your speed, and other
                    related skills.

    * Intelligence: Intelligence controls the amount of 'magic' power
                    you have, how fast this power regenerates, and
                    the success of your special abilities.

    *        Armor: Armor is like shielding; the more you have, the
                    less damage you will take from a given blow.

    *        Level: Your character's level is determined by his
                    experience (currently 0), visible on the right
                    of the screen.  Level affects all stats, and
                    affects what special abilities your character can
                    perform.  While it may look very expensive to buy
                    a level for your character, it can be useful when
                    you're "almost there" and want the increase, as the
                    cost decreases the closer you are to the next level.


  So, from the "Hire" menu you may purchase whatever type(s) of men you
  choose.  You can edit their stats before you buy them, or, if you
  prefer, switch to the "Train" menu instead.  The train menu appears
  similar to the purchasing menu, but the NEXT and PREV buttons will
  take you through your already purchased men.  When you use the "LESS"
  and "MORE" buttons for changing their stats, notice that you do not
  actually pay (and thus make your changes permanent) until you click
  the "ACCEPT" button; this will purchase the changes, provided you have
  the funds, and record your character's stats.

  Clicking the LEFT mouse button on "+" or "-" button will adjust the
  value by one point; clicking the RIGHT mouse button will change by
  five.

  After you have chosen to buy a new character (click the BUY button),
  you get a chance to name your new team member.  Hitting Enter will
  accept the default name, which will be something like SOLDIER1.

  When picking a team, only about the first 25, at most, will appear in
  a scenario; the others are not lost, but will show up on the next level.
  Thus, it is generally best to limit your team to 10 to 20 characters,
  which is normally quite sufficient.

  After you have purchased and edited your team, or any time during
  this phase, you can choose to "VIEW TEAM." This will display a
  screen listing the number of each type of character you have, and
  what "scenario" number you will be attempting next (currently 1).
  This screen also contains a "GO" button:  this will start that
  scenario. There is also a button titled "Set Level."  Clicking
  this button enables you to jump to any level in the game, including
  any levels you may have created with the scenario editor.

  Before hitting go, this time, press (or click) "ESC" several times
  until you get to a point where you can save the game.  Don't worry if
  you go out to the main menu; simply press "continue game" from there;
  all your team members will still be there.  When saving a game, you
  have a choice of 10 slots.  Your current game is always saved by the
  computer as game number 0, and is loaded each time you enter the
  picker.  Each saved game slot allows you a descriptive name to help
  keep games in order; just hit Enter after typing the name to save
  your game.

  After saving your game, you're ready to go!  Find the "GO" button
  (such as from the "VIEW TEAM" menu), click it, and you're off!

B) The Scenarios

  You've just hit the "GO" button from the picker.  After a brief
  fade-out,  you'll see the main screen, which by default will fill
  the entire screen.  Each corner of the screen (top left, etc.)
  contains some important information about the state of the game,
  but more on that in a moment.

  When the level first begins, another button with introduction text
  should appear in the center of the screen.  This text will often
  tell you about the current level, and may list any special goals or
  hints.  You can use the arrow keys or the page up/down keys to
  scroll through the text.  When you are done reading it, hit ESC to
  continue.

  The viewscreen lists several important items.  At the top left should 
  be listed the name or designation of your current character, such
  as "COMMANDER."  Below that are numbers and bar graphs indicating
  your current hitpoints and spellpoints.  Be careful -- when your
  hitpoints go to zero, you're dead!

  At the bottom left will appear "SC: 123" and "XP: 456"  This is your 
  score for the current level, which will start at zero and go up as you
  wreak havok, and your character's experience, which will depend on 
  how much damage that character has personally done.  If you are playing
  an npc (one of the freebie characters) the level instead of the score
  will be displayed.  Right above these numbers should be something
  like "SPC: CHARGE".  This displays your currently-selected special
  ability.  If it prints in yellow, like the others, you can perform
  this action.  If it's red, you are unable to do this special right
  now, most often because you don't have the required magic points.

  The numbers following "TEAM" and "FOES" in the upper right are the 
  number of members left alive on your team, and the number of foes 
  left, respectively.

  Finally, the lower right corner will be filled with a radar map.
  This map shows a larger portion of the playing area than can fit
  on a screen, and can help you determine where enemies and allies
  are.  Your team members are shown as red dots; other teams are shown
  as dots of their respective colors.  Weapons, explosions, and other
  things will often show up briefly as grey dots.

  After hitting ESC to exit the introductory text, the game will begin.
  Gladiator uses an angled, mostly overhead view.  You will see your
  character standing on a field of grass or dirt, perhaps with some
  trees, cobblestone, or water nearby.  Everybody on your team is
  wearing red; the bad guys will wear a variety of colors depending on
  their team (the blue team, the yellow team, etc.).  Normally, when
  you fire, your shots will pass over your teammates and hit your
  enemies; use this to your advantage!

  When you begin Scenario 1, you are a young recruit in a small band
  of warriors.  You, personally (at the keyboard) however, may be
  controlling "Commander."  Commander is an NPC (Non-Player-Character),
  which in this case means that although he is on your team, you are
  not able to buy stats for him or examine him when you are in the
  picker, and he may choose to leave at any time.  There are pro's and
  con's to having NPCs in your group:  they are often somewhat 
  stronger than your men, and can help keep you alive against the odds,
  but they DO NOT EARN EXPERIENCE, and will not go up levels, nor can
  you buy their stats up.  For this reason, it is often good to let
  the NPCs control themselves, and go off hunting experience with your
  own men.  You can tell you are controlling an NPC rather than a
  normal character because the score panel will display his level
  rather than his experience.

  For this scenario, switch characters (press numeric "+") several times
  until you get out of the officers and into the enlisted ranks --
  your personally bought men.  Try out your ranged attack, if you
  have one, by pressing the fire key (INSERT), while staying away from
  enemies.  Try hitting your special key (ENTER) and see what happens.
  Later, when you have more special abilities, you can select them
  with your 'special cycler,' such as numeric "-".  Finally, if
  you've mastered the art of moving around and firing, head up north
  and look for the nasty elves who have been killing the local travelers.

  Don't be too upset if all your men are slaughtered and you lose the
  scenario. There's NO penalty; all that will happen is that you will
  be returned to the picker.  From here, choose "CONTINUE GAME," and
  then just hit the "GO" button to try it again.

  Assuming you're able to overcome the odds and kill all the bad guys
  (the "FOE" count will drop to zero), it's time to look for the exit
  to the next level, which in this scenario is near the top.  Exits
  look like four glowing arrows pointing at each other.  Most often,
  exits won't function until you have killed all the enemies, 
  although in some special cases you can flee while foes are still
  alive (if you step on an exit and nothing happens, kill more foes!).
  When you've completed the scenario, a small window should appear asking
  if you'd like to go on to the next level.  Hitting "Y" will save
  your game and take you to the picker, where you can spend some more
  hard-earned cash before continuing to the next level. A "N" response
  will let you stay on the level.  It's often good to check a completed
  scenario level to see if there are any hidden treasures -- such as
  gold bars or food -- left around.

  On the first scenario, you might notice another exit in the lower
  left corner of the map; taking this exit will jump you to level 10,
  in case you know all about the game and don't need the introductory
  levels to get you started, but it's NOT a good idea to take it when
  you've just started out!

  Even when a good character dies, all is not lost.  A 'heart gem' will
  appear over the corpse of the deceased; any team member can pick it
  up and gain back the majority of what it cost to outfit and train
  that character.  While losing your team members isn't great, you
  may find yourself unable to complete a difficult level without losses,
  so don't worry too much about it.

C) Continuing the cycle

  That's it!  Every time you complete a scenario successfully, your
  current game will be saved and you'll head back to the picker.
  Sometimes there will be places you can pass back through levels you
  have already completed.  There won't be any enemies or treasure here,
  but they can serve as passages and rest-stops between areas you've
  completed and areas yet unsolved.

  Once you've learned the basics of Gladiator, try two player!  To
  toggle the number of players, just click the appropriate button
  on the main screen.  The currently active mode will be highlighted
  in red.

  If you find the game too tough -- or too easy! -- you can control
  the difficulty setting of the game from the main menu.  Clicking
  the "Difficulty" button will select from "Skirmish" (Easy),
  "Battle" (Normal), and "Slaughter" (Difficulty) modes.  In the easy
  mode enemies have fewer hitpoints and mana, but are worth fewer
  points to kill.  The difficult setting is just the opposite: enemies
  are stronger, but worth more to kill.

  The standard Gladiator multi-player system is cooperative (you're
  all on the same team), although racing for experience is fun.  Score
  is shared between the team, while experience goes to the character
  who earned it.

  For players who want to try "player-versus-player" mode, this option
  is available from the training menu.  By default, all characters
  start out on "Team 1."  If you change this setting (you can select
  teams 1 through 4), then each player will control a different team
  of characters.  In this mode, each team has its own score, which
  can be used to hire and train troops.  A character may change his
  team at any point from the training menu.

  The way teams treat each other is controlled from the main menu's
  "Player-v-Player" button.  When this setting is set to "Allied,"
  team members will not actively seek each other out as foes, although
  they may attack NPCs on player teams.  If the "Player-v-Player" setting
  is set to "Enemy," your team will consider everyone not on your own
  team as a deadly enemy.

  You may play the player-versus-player modes on the normal levels, or
  in the "300-range" levels.  To select these levels from the registered
  version, click the "Set Level" button and choose "300" to begin playing.


[4] Hints and Tips

A)  Two (or more)-player mode can really help make things easier.
    Frozen by a faerie?  Get your friend to fry him from the side.

B)  Clerics may feel weak at first, but they're great for healing
    wounded team members.  They're also great for building a 'wall'
    of power to block onrushing foes; call your teammates to you
    while you build a fortress!

C)  Don't forget to use your special!  If you've got the magic to
    burn, it's almost always worth it.

D)  If you have a cleric on your team, and you are hurt, try giving
    him a push.

E)  Don't forget to check how much it costs to train your character
    in a "level."  If she's almost there, you can be a level higher,
    a scenario sooner, without much cost.
